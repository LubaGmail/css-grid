Inline elements:
    respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
    cannot have a width and height set
    allow other elements to sit to their left and right.

Block elements:
    respect all of those
    force a line break after the block element
    acquires full-width if width not defined

Inline-block elements:
    allow other elements to sit to their left and right
    respect top & bottom margins and padding
    respect height and width

An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.
